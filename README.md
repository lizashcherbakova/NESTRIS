# NESTRIS (Modified Version)

## Introduction

**NESTRIS** is a NES Tetris clone that aims to be a perfect recreation in every competitive aspect. Additionally, it aims to lower the input delay to the lowest amount possible. This project has been modified to include a new feature called "Панч" (Punch), which adds a unique twist to the gameplay.

### Modifications

This version of NESTRIS includes the "Панч" (Punch) mechanic, which activates when a tetrimino is destroyed due to the "evaporation" mechanic. The feature adds new dynamics to the game, such as changing the opponent's NEXT field, pausing the addition of tetriminos to the opponent's stack, and more. For a detailed explanation of the "Панч" mechanic, please refer to the game's rules section.

### Some of its characteristics:
- **Language**: C++ for optimization.
- **Delays**: Various lag considerations, including CRT and emulator lag.
- **Performance**: 16-24ms of lag on a 144Hz FreeSync monitor with a PS3 controller and Game Mode on.
- **FPS**: Targeted 60.0988 fps at all times.

### Why I created this project:
- Accessibility issues related to NTSC NES and CRTs in the EU.
- Health and mobility concerns regarding CRTs.
- Preservation of NES gameplay as original hardware becomes scarce.
